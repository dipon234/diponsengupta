
The main objective of the contest is to create an application which helps us to update articles for e-commerce.

Some key points in the logical flow is mentioned in this file.

1. Firstly we need to see if we want to use javascript or PHP for the UI.

2. Secondly we need to initialise all the variables and have a clear picture in mind of which data type to be assigned to which variable.
   For example : Purchase date should be of data type : DATE  in PhP.

3.We need to accept data from the user with the help of a form which enables us to have all the information to be displayed.

4.We need to have a database to store all the information enetered.

5.Finally we need to show the entered data back to the user for confirmation.

Till here we have qualified the data entry process.

For filtering : 

we can filter by price or by category  and the respective data is to be showed and this can be achieved by sql querys easily.

Thank you.
